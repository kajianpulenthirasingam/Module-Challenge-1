# Module-Challenge-1

Website made by Â© 2019 Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. that I editted for more accessibility and fixing errors

Using Wave, I had found some errors to fix on this page. I built this project to solve those errors I found and any other semantic issue. I learned how to include HTML semantincs, how to comment on CSS selectors, and fix coding errors.

For installing my project you just need to clone this code to your repository. This website has links you can click on to other sections of the page.
