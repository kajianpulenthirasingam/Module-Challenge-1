# Module-Challenge-1

Website made by Â© 2019 Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. that I editted for more accessibility and fixing errors

Using Wave, I had found some errors to fix on this page. I built this project to solve those errors I found and any other semantic issue. I learned how to include HTML semantincs, how to comment on CSS selectors, and fix coding errors.
